<div>
<p><strong>Symptoms</strong></p>
<p>When connecting to a MySQL database from either the command-line or from a PHP page, there is an initial delay of a few seconds before the connection is established.&nbsp; There are no reasons for there to be any network latency (i.e. you&rsquo;re connecting from the same machine as your database server or there is a fast link between the two).</p>
<p>This can manifest itself as PHP pages which connect to a database being really slow to load but HTML / CSS / Javascript files being very fast.</p>
<p><strong>Cause</strong></p>
<p>No reverse DNS entry for the IP address from which you are connecting.</p>
<p>By default, MySQL tries to do a reverse DNS lookup on the IP address of every client connection.&nbsp; If there is no reverse DNS entry for the IP address from which you&rsquo;re connecting, this will fail.&nbsp; Depending on your DNS server configuration, it might take a few seconds to time out.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong></p>
<p>Arguably, the&nbsp;<em>correct</em>&nbsp;way to fix this issue is to add a reverse DNS entry for your MySQL client host to your DNS server.&nbsp; Ensuring that your DNS is correctly set up is quite important for a few reasons, this being one.&nbsp; However, there are several situations in which it is either not desirable or practical to create the DNS entry.&nbsp; In this case, simply add the following line to your&nbsp;<em><strong>my.ini</strong></em>&nbsp;MySQL configuration on your database server and restart MySQL:<br />
<code>skip-name-resolve</code></p>
<p>Alternatively, start your MySQL process with the&nbsp;<code>--skip-name-resolve</code>&nbsp;option.</p>
