If you get 5000 emails per day, some sorting will make things easier later as it will allow you to separate messages that you&#39;ll definitely need again to find from those which you probably won&#39;t. Some of the sorting will probably need to be automated though as otherwise, you&#39;d spend a significant amount of time organising.
