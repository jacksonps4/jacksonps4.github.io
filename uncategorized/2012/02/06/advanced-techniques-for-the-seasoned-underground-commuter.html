<meta name="description" content="The door game I mentioned the door game briefly in my previous article on tube etiquette. This involves making sure that when you embark on a tube journey, you board at the same door at which you need to alight - saving you a walk at the other end. For example, if you&#39;re going to Canary Wharf on the Jubilee line and you need to get towards the DLR, the exit escalators are at the forward end of the platform - so you should be aiming to board at the very front of the train. Listen carefully You&#39;ve seen those passengers who get out of their seats as the train appears to be coming to a halt - only to realise when the train stops that it is still nowhere near a platform and all that can be seen through the doors is a dark tunnel wall. The noise of the train travelling over points and changes in the wind noise due to the size of the tunnel both tell you where you are. If you commute on a daily basis, you will get to know these noises and if you&#39;re lucky enough to have one, you won&#39;t get out of your seat until the train is definitely in the station. Knowing when it&#39;s quicker to walk! Particularly when dealing with journeys within zone one or into zone one from just outside it, there are many occasions when it is undoubtedly quicker to walk. This has several benefits. It&#39;s cheaper (free) London is a good city to walk around Your geographical knowledge of London will improve Extreme examples of such journeys where it is most definitely quicker to walk include the following journeys, which should always be attempted on foot before taking public transport: Charing Cross to Embankment Southwark to Waterloo or London Bridge London Bridge to Bank Any journey between West India Quay, Canary Wharf and Heron Quays Watch out for abandoned or disused stations You can often see them from the train whilst on your travels. Next time you&#39;re on the Bank branch of the Northern line, whilst facing forwards, look out of the right side between Old St and Angel: listen for a slight change in noise as the tunnel opens out and you&#39;ll see the remains of the platforms of the station that was once City Road, which closed in 1922 (you can see some photos of the exterior here [thanks to Liz Clutterbuck] and some of the details on Wikipedia). Routes around stations when changing The general rule is not to follow the signs. Most stations try to direct you in a manner that keeps congestion to a minimum. However, usually the signage does not send you on the shortest route. Once of the best examples of this is to be found at King&#39;s Cross St Pancras station. From the main Underground entrance on Euston Road, the shortest way to the Northern line is straight down the escalator, then right and back on yourself. However, the signs direct you to the other end of the station via a load of other escalators and tunnels. Not the most direct. More information Fellow TfL geeks should check out these sites as they have a lot of information that you are unlikely to find out anywhere else.

    <h3>The door game</h3>
<p>I mentioned the door game briefly in <a href="/wordpress/?p=934">my previous article on tube etiquette</a>. This involves making sure that when you embark on a tube journey, you board at the same door at which you need to alight - saving you a walk at the other end. For example, if you're going to Canary Wharf on the Jubilee line and you need to get towards the DLR, the exit escalators are at the forward end of the platform - so you should be aiming to board at the very front of the train.</p>
<h3>Listen carefully</h3>
<p>You've seen those passengers who get out of their seats as the train appears to be coming to a halt - only to realise when the train stops that it is still nowhere near a platform and all that can be seen through the doors is a dark tunnel wall. The noise of the train travelling over points and changes in the wind noise due to the size of the tunnel both tell you where you are. If you commute on a daily basis, you will get to know these noises and if you're lucky enough to have one, you won't get out of your seat until the train is definitely in the station.</p>
<h3>Knowing when it's quicker to walk!</h3>
<p>Particularly when dealing with journeys within zone one or into zone one from just outside it, there are many occasions when it is undoubtedly quicker to walk. This has several benefits.</p>
<ul>
<li>It's cheaper (free)</li>
<li>London is a good city to walk around</li>
<li>Your geographical knowledge of London will improve</li>
</ul>
<p>Extreme examples of such journeys where it is most definitely quicker to walk include the following journeys, which should always be attempted on foot before taking public transport:</p>
<ul>
<li>Charing Cross to Embankment</li>
<li>Southwark to Waterloo or London Bridge</li>
<li>London Bridge to Bank</li>
<li>Any journey between West India Quay, Canary Wharf and Heron Quays</li>
</ul>
<h3>Watch out for abandoned or disused stations</h3>
<p>You can often see them from the train whilst on your travels. Next time you're on the Bank branch of the Northern line, whilst facing forwards, look out of the right side between Old St and Angel: listen for a slight change in noise as the tunnel opens out and you'll see the remains of the platforms of the station that was once City Road, which closed in 1922 (you can see <a href="http://lizclutterbuck.blogspot.com/2010/09/nerds-idea-of-fun-day-out.html">some photos of the exterior here</a> [thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/lizaclutterbuck">Liz Clutterbuck</a>] and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Road_tube_station">some of the details on Wikipedia</a>).</p>
<h3>Routes around stations when changing</h3>
<p>The general rule is not to follow the signs. Most stations try to direct you in a manner that keeps congestion to a minimum. However, usually the signage does not send you on the shortest route. Once of the best examples of this is to be found at King's Cross St Pancras station.

However, the signs direct you to the other end of the station via a load of other escalators and tunnels. Not the most direct.</p>
