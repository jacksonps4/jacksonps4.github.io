<meta name="description" content="A few weeks ago I decided to try to reduce my caffeine intake to see if would have any effect of my levels of tiredness, sleep quality or anything else. I found the results quite surprising. I&#39;ve never really thought of myself as a caffeine fiend. Most weekdays, I&#39;d probably have two &quot;tall&quot; Americano type coffees and sometimes a cup of tea or two. However, this represents around 300mg of caffeine (the recommended daily limit is around 400mg or 200mg for pregnant women). So, after having about four coffees and four cups of tea on a Saturday, the next day, I had no tea, coffee or caffeine of any sort. Having had a good night&#39;s sleep, I didn&#39;t notice any significant effects. However, by the Monday afternoon, I had a headache that persisted into early on the Thursday. This was accompanied by aches down the backs of my legs which continued until the Saturday. As withdrawal symptoms go, I would class these as a mild discomfort but they were definitely noticeable. Thankfully, by the following Sunday, all was well. I felt my normal self again. I was definitely sleeping for longer and feeling tired earlier. I wish I could say that I was waking up feeling more energised but I haven&#39;t noticed any changes there. I do however, feel a little more alert and able to think (particularly in the early afternoon) than I did before. I haven&#39;t cut caffeine out altogether - I&#39;ve still been eating chocolate and having the occasional cup of tea and I am certainly not planning never to drink tea or coffee again. It was just interesting to see what happens to me when I don&#39;t have any caffeine." />

A few weeks ago I decided to try to reduce my caffeine intake to see if would have any effect of my levels of tiredness, sleep quality or anything else. I found the results quite surprising.</p>
<p>
I've never really thought of myself as a caffeine fiend. Most weekdays, I'd probably have two "tall" Americano type coffees and sometimes a cup of tea or two. However, this represents around 300mg of caffeine (the recommended daily limit is around 400mg or 200mg for pregnant women).</p>
<p>
So, after having about four coffees and four cups of tea on a Saturday, the next day, I had no tea, coffee or caffeine of any sort. Having had a good night's sleep, I didn't notice any significant effects. However, by the Monday afternoon, I had a headache that persisted into early on the Thursday. This was accompanied by aches down the backs of my legs which continued until the Saturday. As withdrawal symptoms go, I would class these as a mild discomfort but they were definitely noticeable.</p>
<p>Thankfully, by the following Sunday, all was well. I felt my normal self again. I was definitely sleeping for longer and feeling tired earlier. I wish I could say that I was waking up feeling more energised but I haven't noticed any changes there. I do however, feel a little more alert and able to think (particularly in the early afternoon) than I did before.</p>

I haven't cut caffeine out altogether - I've still been eating chocolate and having the occasional cup of tea and I am certainly not planning never to drink tea or coffee again. It was just interesting to see what happens to me when I don't have any caffeine.</p>
