    <p><strong>UPDATE</strong> There is a newer <a href="http://jacksonps4.me/wordpress/?p=1013">version of this article here</a>. Please take a look as it provides an easier way to achieve the same thing.</p>
<p>For those Java web application developers who use the fairly standard combination of Eclipse as an IDE and Maven as a build lifecycle / dependency management tool, a really nice feature of Eclipse is that it enables you to deploy your project to embedded servlet containers (e.g. Tomcat / Jetty).&nbsp; This takes the headache out of building and deploying to a standalone servlet container by building the package with Maven and then copying it across every time you make a change.&nbsp; It also makes debugging easier as you can set breakpoints and test in Eclipse itself rather than having to wire up a remote debugger.</p>
<p>The difficulty is that that getting projects to work like this in Eclipse can be a bit of a black art.&nbsp; Here is how I usually get Maven webapp projects set up in Eclipse such that they can be deployed to a Tomcat container.</p>
<p>These instructions are for Eclipse 3.6 (Helios).</p>
<ul>
<li>At the command line, change to the project directory containing its pom.xml file.</li>
<li>Create a Maven eclipse project using the plugin:<br />
<code>> mvn -Dwtpversion=2.0 eclipse:eclipse</code></li>
<li>Import the project into Eclipse: File -> Existing project into workspace -> select project directory.</li>
<li>Right click on the new project -> Maven -> Enable dependency management</li>
<li>Now, to get the Maven dependency management set up to package of the jar files referenced by the project pom.xml file into the WEB-INF/lib directory of your project package, edit the [project-directory]/.settings/org.eclipse.wst.common.component file and add the following lines:<br />
<code><dependent-module deploy-path="/WEB-INF/lib" handle="module:/classpath/con/org.maven.ide.eclipse.MAVEN2_CLASSPATH_CONTAINER"><br />
<dependency-type>consumes</dependency-type><br />
</dependent-module></code></li>
<li>Now refresh the project, add it to your Tomcat server instance: Windows -> Show view -> Other -> Server -> Servers - then right click your server instance and select 'add and remove', then select your project.</li>
</ul>
<p>This should get you up and running.</p>
