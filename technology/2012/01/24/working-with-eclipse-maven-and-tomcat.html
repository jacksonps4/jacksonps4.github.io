    <p>It occurred to me recently that my <a href="http://jacksonps4.me/wordpress/?p=868">previous article on working with Eclipse, Maven and Tomcat</a> and making them "play nicely" seems a little out of date. There have been quite a few advancements in all of those technologies since the original publication of the guide. The old article gets plenty of hits as it is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2651404/eclipse-maven-tomcat-debugging">linked from a Stackoverflow thread</a>, so by way of ensuring this information is current, I am going to detail how I currently work with Maven web-app projects to run on Tomcat using Eclipse as an IDE. It is considerably simpler now than it used to be to get a working usable setup.</p>
<h3>Goals</h3>
<ul>
<li>Application will run in Eclipse and standalone without modification - hence simple debugging is possible</li>
<li>Don't need to deploy the application to test it</li>
<li>No configuration required in the web container to make the application work</li>
</ul>
<h3>Running a web application using Tomcat in Eclipse</h3>
<p>I am using Eclipse Indigo (although the same should work with Helios and the M2Eclipse plugin). Assuming you have a Maven WAR project in Eclipse with a deployment descriptor located in the project at <code>src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml</code>, you can launch it easily in Eclipse by doing </p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click your web app project -> Run as -> Run configurations</li>
<li>Right click Maven Build in the left pane -> New</li>
<li>Set the name to something suitable (usually your project name)</li>
<li>For base directory, enter <code>${workspace_loc:/your-project-name}</code></li>
<li>For goal, enter <code>tomcat:run</code></li>
<li>Click run</li>
</ol>
<p>For future launches, you should simply be able to click the <code>Run as</code> or <code>Debug as</code> icons on the toolbar and select the name that you chose in step 3. You can set breakpoints if needed.</p>
<h3>Running a web application standalone</h3>
<p>Here, there are two choices. </p>
<p>From the root of the Maven project, you can issue the command <code>mvn tomcat:run</code>. Alternatively, you can build your WAR file using <code>mvn package</code> and copy the .WAR file from the <code>target/</code> directory to a Tomcat or other servlet container deployment directory and start it up.</p>
